# Single-Player Battleship Game

This is a simple single-player Battleship game implemented in C++. The objective of the game is to find and sink a hidden ship on a 9x9 grid.

## How to Play
1. The game starts by displaying an empty grid, representing the ocean.

2. The ship's position is randomly determined and hidden on the grid.

3. You have a limited number of attempts to guess the ship's location.

4. Enter the X and Y coordinates of the cell you want to target.

5. If your guess hits the ship, you win the game.

6. If your guess misses, the grid will display a 'W' to represent water.

7. The game continues until you either sink the ship or run out of attempts.

8. After the game ends, the complete grid is displayed, showing the ship's location.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system, or install IDE like Codeblocks (see: https://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/).

2. Compile the source code.

3. Good Game!
